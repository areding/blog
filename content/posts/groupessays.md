One of my favorite exercises for small classes of intermediate students is the group essay. When I first started teaching, we would always write individual essays, as called for in the provided lesson plan. But that resulted in long periods of quiet, which isn’t great for an oral English class.

So I asked the students to take turns coming up with a sentence while I transcribed them. The result is usually a much more engaged class. Even the shyest students participate.

I don’t limit what they can write for the most part, and I use the opportunity to teach some minor grammar points appropriate for their level. My goal isn’t to make the grammar or writing perfect - just to reinforce what they’ve learned and get them to use language creatively.

Here’s an example. The essay prompt was something like this: you’re walking on a beach, and see a tree with a box. Describe what you see, what’s in the box, and what you do after. 

> I walked slowly along the beach. I saw many trees. I saw many beautiful girls. It's very exciting.
>
> I saw a tree. It was very tall. I climbed to the top, and I heard many beautiful songs. They are from the sea. Suddenly, I saw a box on the tree. I take the box. It's black and small. I open the box, and find something special.
>
> Inside the box, there is an old man's diary. Inside the diary, there is a treasure map. The treasure map says to walk along the beach and inside the second tree, under the tree, you can find many things that you want. I dug a hole under the second tree. I found a paper.
>
> On the paper, there is a saying, "You must try your best to face any danger." I swam into the sea and died.
>
> THE END

The prompt for this next one was “Where will your next vacation be? Will you stay in a hotel or with friends? What will you do?”

>We are going to America this vacation. First, we will find a bad hotel for 10 yuan. Then we will eat food for 5 yuan. We will sell our luggage and clothes. We will get a lot of money, but then, we will be arrested for not having any clothes. And go to jail.
>
>We can live in the jail. We have food, new clothes, and a place to sleep. It is very free. It's very comfortable. We can make a lot of friends, although they are not very friendly. Then we can escape from the jail and kill people. Then we can't use the money.
>
>Then, we will be deported to China. And we didn't spend any money on the plane ticket home. And this trip, we only spent 15 yuan, and the money for the plane ticket there. We are very frugal.

It is very free.
