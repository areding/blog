This is my general approach to learning Chinese and the resources I've found helpful.

First, I feed my brain some content, whether it's a menu, a song or three, a story from DuChinese, a TV show, or a podcast. Then add some words from the content into my spaced repetition software, study the flashcards of the day, and that's it.  I don't study handwriting. I also usually throw in some passive listening of music or podcasts after that. 

### Utilities

[Hack Chinese](https://www.hackchinese.com/)

I'm using this right now. I never liked the work of creating new cards in Anki, although I've seen lots of people say they get some benefit from it. They have a bunch of premade vocabulary lists if you're working towards a specific goal, or you can create your own lists. It also syncs with [DuChinese](https://www.duchinese.net/lessons). Here's my [referral link](https://www.hackchinese.com/?r=2d4450) (we both get 2 free months if you use it).

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)

The most popular spaced repetition software. Manually create cards or you can find premade lists online in various places.

[Pleco](https://www.pleco.com/)

This is known as the best dictionary app around, but they also have a good spaced repetition system.



### Read

Read slightly below your level to improve fluency and speed, read slightly above your level to find new vocabulary.

[DuChinese](https://www.duchinese.net/lessons)

Tons of graded content with really nice interface and iPhone app. Audio is also good quality.

### Listen

#### Music

Music is probably not as good for learning pronunciation because tones are often ignored, but it's useful for getting words to stick in your head.





#### Podcasts
