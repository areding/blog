      <description>Redoing an older Bayesian Statistics course with more modern tools I&amp;rsquo;m working on translating the examples from Professor Vidakovic&amp;rsquo;s Bayesian Statistics course at Georgia Tech from MATLAB and OpenBUGS to Python (using libraries PyMC3 and pgmpy). As a former student and current TA, by far the number one complaint I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about the course is that OpenBUGS is outdated and a waste of time to learn. I chose PyMC because among the newer Probabilistic Programming Languages it seems the easiest to learn, especially since I&amp;rsquo;m most familiar with Python.</description>

      <description>For quite a while after I first came to China, I was scared to go to new restaurants alone and order in Chinese.

Unfortunately, as my Chinese got better, my weight went back up.) This post is about</description>

      <description>One of my favorite exercises for small classes of intermediate students is the group essay. When I first started teaching, we would always write individual essays, as called for in the provided lesson plan. But that resulted in long periods of quiet, which isnâ€™t great for an oral English class.
So I asked the students to take turns coming up with a sentence while I transcribed them. The result is usually a much more engaged class.</description>
