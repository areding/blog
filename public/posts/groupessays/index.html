				<h1>Group essays in small classes</h1>
			</header>
			<div class="content">
				<p>One of my favorite exercises for small classes of intermediate students is the group essay. When I first started teaching, we would always write individual essays, as called for in the provided lesson plan. But that resulted in long periods of quiet, which isn’t great for an oral English class.</p>
<p>So I asked the students to take turns coming up with a sentence while I transcribed them. The result is usually a much more engaged class. Even the shyer students participate.</p>
<p>I don’t limit what they can write for the most part, and I use the opportunity to teach some minor grammar points appropriate for their level. My goal isn’t to make the grammar or writing perfect, just to reinforce what they’ve learned and get them to use language creatively.</p>
<p>The main reason I want to post this is to save some of these classics for posterity.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples<a href="#examples" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>
<p>This first essay prompt was something like this: you’re walking on a beach, and see a tree with a box. Describe what you see, what’s in the box, and what you do after.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I walked slowly along the beach. I saw many trees. I saw many beautiful girls. It&rsquo;s very exciting.</p>
<p>I saw a tree. It was very tall. I climbed to the top, and I heard many beautiful songs. They are from the sea. Suddenly, I saw a box on the tree. I take the box. It&rsquo;s black and small. I open the box, and find something special.</p>
<p>Inside the box, there is an old man&rsquo;s diary. Inside the diary, there is a treasure map. The treasure map says to walk along the beach and inside the second tree, under the tree, you can find many things that you want. I dug a hole under the second tree. I found a paper.</p>
<p>On the paper, there is a saying, &ldquo;You must try your best to face any danger.&rdquo; I swam into the sea and died.</p>
<p>THE END</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>The prompt for this next one was “Where will your next vacation be? Will you stay in a hotel or with friends? What will you do?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are going to America this vacation. First, we will find a bad hotel for 10 yuan. Then we will eat food for 5 yuan. We will sell our luggage and clothes. We will get a lot of money, but then, we will be arrested for not having any clothes. And go to jail.</p>
<p>We can live in the jail. We have food, new clothes, and a place to sleep. It is very free. It&rsquo;s very comfortable. We can make a lot of friends, although they are not very friendly. Then we can escape from the jail and kill people. Then we can&rsquo;t use the money.</p>
<p>Then, we will be deported to China. And we didn&rsquo;t spend any money on the plane ticket home. And this trip, we only spent 15 yuan, and the money for the plane ticket there. We are very frugal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is very free.</p>
<hr>
<p>Write a letter to your friend describing your vacation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>How are you? I miss you very much. I love you.</p>
<p>Last weekend, I went to Vietnam with my friends. We visited some interesting places such as the sea. We went to the sea and ate fresh seafood. And we bought some interesting things. We went to the biggest restaurant in Vietnam. We ate braised red-crown crane, steamed giant panda, and roast koala. Then the policeman came and arrested us because we ate these protected animals. Then we went to the police station. The bed at the police station was very comfortable. We ate some delicious food, such as more braised red-crown crane.</p>
<p>Then the policemen kicked us. We were hurt. Then we went to the hospital. The doctor told me my arm was broken. Then I took a break. The next day, I felt very good so I hung out with my friends, and we had a big meal. I lost my passport, so I can&rsquo;t come back to China. Help me, please!</p>
<p>My phone number is 1582102384. My email is <a href="mailto:32145@qq.com">32145@qq.com</a>. You can follow me on Weibo. I will broadcast the escape.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Sandwich, Lisa, Denver</p>

<p>I think they had just learned &ldquo;such as.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another variation on the beach dream essay.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I go along the beach and there are bodies everywhere. I walk on a brain. The sky was very dark. There is an old woman, and I can see her eyes. She catches me, and asks me, &ldquo;Do you need insurance?&rdquo; I run away and I shout to her, &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t! You must be crazy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I go along again. I can see many fish on the beach. They are all dead. Suddenly, I see a yellow box, and a pink star. They catch me. I ask them, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; The yellow box answers, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m SpongeBob.&rdquo; The pink star answers, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Patrick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I cook them for dinner. Really delicious. Then I see a tree. There are many dead bodies hanging on the branches. They all say, &ldquo;Do you need insurance?&rdquo; They are all chasing me. I climb up a tree. I stay there for five days. Suddenly, an old man killed the zombies. He lets me say, &ldquo;Shazam!&rdquo; And I say no!</p>
<p>The old man is very angry. He asks, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; And I answer, &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m Batman.&rdquo; The old man is very surprised. The old man asks, &ldquo;Do you need insurance?&rdquo; In the end, I say, &ldquo;Expecto Patronum!&rdquo; And the world has peace.</p>
<p>​		THE END</p>
