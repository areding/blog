      <title>BUGS to PyMC</title>

      <description>Redoing an older Bayesian Statistics course with more modern tools I&amp;rsquo;m working on translating the examples from Professor Vidakovic&amp;rsquo;s Bayesian Statistics course at Georgia Tech from MATLAB and OpenBUGS to Python (using libraries PyMC3 and pgmpy). As a former student and current TA, by far the number one complaint I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about the course is that OpenBUGS is outdated and a waste of time to learn. I chose PyMC because among the newer Probabilistic Programming Languages it seems the easiest to learn, especially since I&amp;rsquo;m most familiar with Python.</description>
