      <description>One of my favorite exercises for small classes of intermediate students is the group essay. When I first started teaching, we would always write individual essays, as called for in the provided lesson plan. But that resulted in long periods of quiet, which isnâ€™t great for an oral English class.
So I asked the students to take turns coming up with a sentence while I transcribed them. The result is usually a much more engaged class.</description>
